  <p>Frieren Communist GPUs</p>
</div>

The image comes from the anime [Frieren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren) and the [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-can-just-give-this-kind-of-thing-to-men-and-they-will-be-thrilled). Frieren, the elven immortal mage, has beaten the Demon King alongside her friends in a span of about 10 years, yet since she has lived more than a thousand years, it is just a glimpse of her life. Frieren has spent all her life collecting spells and seeing the world as eternal. It is not until one of her old party members dies that she feels guilty of not connecting with others. The image depicts Frieren giving communist GPUs/TPUs (chips) because that is what I really want: a communist distributed system that is capable of computing in a massive parallel way and chips for training AI models.
