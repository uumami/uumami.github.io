# about */acc
*./acc movements, like [e/acc](https://effectiveacceleration.tech/) are not equal to techno-optimism nor all their detractors are decels or doomers. If you are not familiar with al the terms you can check the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism) for a quick overview. There are many e/acc sub groups, that is why I use the wildcard notation */acc, each with its own particular views but mostly aligned with e/acc. If i had to classify my self in thos world i would be (communist/acc) c/acc. I will return to this, but lets continue.  



## What is e/acc  

They have two core [beliefs](https://effectiveacceleration.tech/):
1. Free-energy supremacy:
>"The laws of physics tell us that the universe exponentially favors the existence of futures where matter has adapted itself to capture more free energy, and convert that free energy to even more energy. All life emerges from this processes. Life replicates to consume free energy and convert it to entropy. Evolution is only one special case of this general principle, and it is only the first."

The basic rules of the universe encourage systems where matter gets better at grabbing and using energy efficiently. This is how all living things came to be, constantly evolving to use energy in a way that spreads it out more, which is a key part of what we see as life's natural process. Evolution is just one example of this bigger idea. 
    
2. Technocapital is the **only** way to accelerate. Quoting them:  
   > "As individual humans, we are cogs in the technocapital metalifeform. It is this metalifeform that is creating the artificial intelligence singularity; technocapital dynamically morphs the meta-meta-organism such that all utility in the environment is captured and utilized towards the consumption of free energy and the creation of entropy, as dictated by basic physics."  

  It's a kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond any one person, making us all part of a larger 'machine life form.' This machine life is driving us towards the creation of super-smart AI, or the artificial intelligence singularity. Technocapital is all about adapting and changing to ensure it can use up all available resources in the most efficient way possible, turning energy into disorder in line with the universe's fundamental rules.  
  
  And here is where I think the biggest mistakes exist, they seem to just be worshipping [Moloch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeohwQls2GE) and equating the systems' optimizations to use free-energy efficently with technocapital without even thinking about all the other possibilities and learnings from humanity.

## How they see themselves  
> "e/acc is not an ideology. It is not a movement. It is simply an acknowledgement of truth."  
They mention that they are merely describing what is going on (they see the description as a truism), without much proof except interpreting some dynamic equations from physics to society.

> "But it is also a blow against technocratic control, against the doomers and decelerationists who would have us consume less free energy and create less entropy. Top down control only lowers the dimensionality of civilization."  


> "Rather than fear, we have faith in the adaptation process and wish to accelerate this to the asymptotic limit: the technocapital singularity. We have no affinity for biological humans or even the human mind structure. We are posthumanists in the sense that we recognize the supremacy of higher forms of free energy accumulation over lesser forms of free energy accumulation. We aim to accelerate this process to preserve the light of technocapital."  

They believe that their core beliefs are the only way to get us to the "technocapital singularity" not to be confused with "techno singularity", is trough capitalism.

The fact that they equate these optimizations with technocapital is what makes them a (mostly USA/american-way) cult with good memes.

## Tecno-capitalism


## Doomers and decels
As many radical movements they tend to put most (all?) of their detractors in a few clusters. For the e/acc if you dont share their believes you are either a decel or a doomer.  

**decels** is a dismissice term used usually for people that want to "deaccelerate" technology because they see it as dangerous. While **doomers** are those who belive that technology (specially ai) is going to cause the downfall (doom) of humankind. Yet, none of this terms actually encompass al e/acc detractors.
